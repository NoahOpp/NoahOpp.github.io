            <h2>💭 General Impression</h2>
            <p>
                I loved learning more about sleep as its something that is such a integral part of everyones life and I
                knew so little about it.
                I thought the Author put himself into the book a bit too much and it often ended up annoying me.
                He came off as a white knight. The book was easy to read and really stressed how important it is to
                prioritize sleep.
                That is fine, I know sleep is important, however being told about the numerous adverse effects of a lack
                of sleep does not help one relax and go to sleep at night.
                It often felt like. You, and your life will be worse in every way if you don’t sleep enough; Ok, Good
                night.
                I also felt some of the studies particularly when it comes to drugs effect on sleep where done missing
                the point of why someone takes drugs to sleep.
                If someone is extremely stressed to the point where they wont sleep without aid.
                The inorganic drug induced sleep surely must be better than no sleep at all.

                This book does make me wonder whether part of my many problems is my inability to fully sleep.
                My  garmin watch only ever gives me a max sleep score of 70. Do I ever sleep adequately?
                How do I know if I sleep adequately? Would I be a superhuman if I always got 8 hours of high quality sleep? 
                These are the questions that keep me up at night.

            <blockquote>““The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night’s sleep.”</blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Practice does not make perfect. It is practice, followed by a night of sleep, that leads to
                perfection.”</blockquote>
            <blockquote>“If sleep does not serve a absolutely vital functions then it is the biggest mistake the
                evolutionary process has ever made”</blockquote>

            <h2>👤 Who Should Read It?</h2>
            <p>I think everyone should read this book. Everyone sleeps after all.

                I think this book is especially important for people who don’t get at least 7 hours of sleep every
                night. This goes double for people who think they function well off 6 hours of sleep a night.
                (unfortunately, you most likely do not)</p>

            <h2> ☘️ How the Book Changed Me </h2>

            <p>
                <li> I am now extremely conscious of my sleep time and quality </li>
                <li> I understand better the importance of sleep in learning and thus, make it a priority </li>
                <li> I now use melatonin when i know that my circadian rhythm has been shifted and i dont have adequate
                    melatonin to go to bed when I want </li>
                <li> I also now understand more how drinking and drugs effect me in regards to how they disrupt sleep. I
                    have drank less and and am much more hesitant to take any drug to help me sleep. </li>

                <p>We spend a third of our life sleeping</p>
                <p>It was not too long ago that we knew very little about sleep</p>
                <p>Society has a apathy towards sleep that can be explained by the fact that we used to not know why we
                    need it.</p>

                        Melatonin</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The circadian rhythm is your bodies internal clock that signals to all other parts of your body
                        when it is time to be asleep and when it is time to be awake.</li>
                    <li>The circadian rhythm is on a 25 hour time scale and it releases melatonin to signal to the brain
                        and body that it is time to go to sleep.</li>
                    <li>The brain uses daylight as the main signal to reset the cicadian rhythm to coincide with
                        daytime.</li>
                    <li>Peoples circadian rhythms are different and some people are naturally shifted forward or
                        backward in the day leading to early risers and late risers.</li>
                    <li>Adenosine is a chemical that builds up in your brain when one stays up. It causes sleep pressure
                        and the urge to sleep that comes with it. Caffeine works by attaching to the receptors that
                        attach to adenosine effectively “blocking” it. This means caffeine keeps at bay sleep pressure
                        and makes you feel awake. Sleep of course also reduces adenosine</li>
                    <li>A good way to tell of your getting enough sleep is if you feel drowsy through the day. Another
                        good way is seeing how long you would sleep without a alarm. IF it it much longer than you would
                        sleep with your alarm then its not enough. The body is generally good at knowing what it needs.

                <ul>
                    <li>There are two types of sleep : REM and non-REM or NREM</li>
                    <li>REM stands for rapid eye movement as your eyes move rapidly back and forth when one is in this
                        stage of sleep.</li>
                    <li>in REM sleep the brain waves are nearly identical to when we are awake. This is when we are
                        dreaming.</li>
                    <li>There are 4 stages of NREM sleep with stages 3 and 4 being slow wave sleep. The brain waves are
                        slow and melodic in this stage of sleep</li>
                    <li>Our brain cycles through all 4 stages of NREM sleep and then REM sleep in 90 minute cycles that
                        repeat fairly uniformly. However we tend to get most of our REM sleep in teh second half of the
                        night.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>All animals sleep in some form or another</li>
                    <li>Animals that evolved earlier do not show signs of partaking in REM sleep</li>
                    <li>Animals sleep in distinct ways, some birds can sleep with half of their brain at one time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>How Should We Sleep?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are Biphasic sleepers. We are hard wired to have a dip in alertness mid afternoon that often
                        coincides with a nap. These naps are healthy and lead to a longer life span</li>
                    <li>Human sleep less than other primates and yet our sleep is filled with more REM sleep.</li>
                    <li>This increased REM sleep is part of the reason Humans are smarter than other primates. Or maybe
                        as we got smarter we needed more REM sleep to upkeep the increasingly complex connections within
                        our brains</li>
                    <li>REM sleep creates the connections within our brain</li>
                </ul>

                        the Life Span</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Babies just prior to being born consume more sleep than at any other time in the human life
                        span- Nearly 12 hours a day.</li>
                    <li>A lack or REM sleep in babies leads to problems with brain development.</li>
                    <li>Autism is correlated with a lack of REM sleep</li>
                    <li>A reason that mothers should not drink while pregnant is because it reduced the babies REM sleep
                        and therefore can impair the brain development of the brain. Alcohol in breast milk can do the
                        same</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Childhood Sleep</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the child gets older the proportion of NREM sleep increases. NREM sleep serves to refine and
                        prune the connections within our brain. This essentially remodels our brain to work more
                        efficiently. Connections that are used more often are made more robust and connections that are
                        more rarely used are reduced. This is the brain maturing. It matures from front to back and the
                        frontal lobe which controls our rational thinking is the last thing to be pruned by NREM sleep
                        and therefore the last thing to develop. This is why teenagers are often irrational</li>
                    <li>People with schitzofrenia have non-regular NREM sleep suggesting a problem in the maturing of
                        the brain, potentially causing schizophrenia.<ul>
                            <li>NREM sleep does synaptic pruning which matures our brain how interesting is that.</li>
                            <li>Children&#39;s Circadian rhythm are longer and shifted earlier in the day.</li>
                            <li>Teenagers Circadian rhythm gets shifted later in the day. This is why they want to go to
                                bed late and sleep in.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sleep in Midlife and Old Age</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As we age we get less and less Deep wave NREM sleep. this starts in our late 20’s</li>
                    <li>Seniors often sleep less and yet they don’t need less sleep. This lack of sleep in seniors can
                        be a reason for the mental and physical decline faced by seniors.</li>
                    <li>This lack of ability to sleep for seniors is caused by a weakening of circadian rhythm and
                        reduction of the melatonin being released.</li>
                    <li>Older adults don’t need less sleep, it is just harder for them to sleep sufficiently</li>

                <p>all types of sleep are equally necessary to function well and the different stages of sleep happen at
                    different stages of the night. So cutting of the beginning or end of your sleep can cause similar
                    undesirable and yet distinct problems.</p>
                <p>The Benefits of Sleep for the Brain</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>sleep the night before learning refreshes our ability to intake new information into short term
                        memory.</li>
                    <li>sleep the night after learning consolidates what is learned into long term memory</li>
                    <li>NREM sleep (beginning of the night) transfers the memory packets from short term learning
                        (hippocampus) to long term learning (neocortex)</li>
                    <li>NREM sleep, particularly sleep spindles which are burst of brain activity in stage 2 NREM sleep,
                        help to consolidate memories that need to be consolidated and forget memories that need not be
                        remembered. The more sleep spindles that occur the more effectively this happens</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sleep for Other Types of Memory</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>sleep helps create muscle memory. People are better able to perform practice skilled like that
                        of the piano after a night of sleep.</li>
                    <li>This is only tangentially related but rate of injury in athletes is reduced with adequate sleep.
                        Performance is increased. As if I wasn’t already convinced as to the miracle of sleep</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>sleep reduces your attention span. Mini sleeps while driving are especially dangerous</li>
                    <li>people do not know how sleep deprived they are when they are sleep deprived. The conscious brain
                        is not aware of the lack of sleep. The unconscious brain surely keeps the score though</li>
                    <li>The people that can actually function well off 6 hours a night of sleep, and yes there is a gene
                        for that, make up only .5% of the population. So, no. Its probably not you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Emotional Irrationality</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lack of sleep makes people emotionally volatile. They swing from jubilant to angry to
                        depressed with reduced ability to control swings</li>
                    <li>Loss of control over the brain from the prefrontal cortex( does our planning, impulse control,
                        decision making, problem solving) This is really what makes humans smart. You want this working
                        at 100%</li>
                    <li>Brain activity resembles that of people with neurological diseases when sleep deprived. The two
                        are profoundly linked.</li>
                    <li>There is no major psychiatric disorder in which sleep is normal.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>pulling all nighters is a terrible study technique. That is a shocker.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sleep and Alzheimer’s Disease</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ALzheimers disease is associated with a toxic form of protein called beta-amyloid. This amyloids
                        builds up in parts of the brain and kills the nearby neurons. This deteriorates the brain cells
                        and brain as a whole. However this “amyloid” protein only groups up in certain parts of the
                        brain.</li>
                    <li>One of the areas that the amyloids group up is in the middle part of the frontal lobe, the same
                        part that generates slow wave deep NREM sleep. Reduced NREM sleep can be a sign and maybe even
                        predictor of Alzheimer’s</li>
                    <li>The brain has the glymphatic system, which is like the lymphatic system, but in the brain. This
                        glymphatic system is much more active while sleeping, around 15 times more active. Cells even
                        shrink within the brain while sleeping to allow the cerebral spinal fluid that is the mean of
                        the glymphatic system to more effectively clear away waste product. One of the proteins cleared
                        away is amyloid. Therefore a persistent lack of sleep increases chances of early onset
                        alzheimer’s</li>
                    <li>People with sleep disorders are more likely to get alzheimer’s. because of the above</li>

                <p>Sleep Loss and the Cardiovascular System</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sleep deprivation greatly increases the chances of stroke or heart disease as we age. This is
                        because sleep loss accelerates the heart rate and increases blood pressure weakening vein walls.
                    </li>
                    <li>Essentially sleep deprivation puts your body into a somewhat fight or flight reaction. This
                        comes with it all the well known negatives of having too much stress</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Weight Gain and Obesity</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sleep loss raises your blood sugar which can lead to diabetes and all its terrible complications
                    </li>
                    <li>People eat more calories and more unhealthily when sleep deprived</li>
                    <li>when people do lose weight when sleep deprived more of it comes from lean body mass rather than
                        fat. That is surely not ideal</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sleep Loss and the Reproductive System</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>sleep deprivation drastically lowers your testosterone. This subsequently causes all kinds of
                        unfortunate side effects. People with sleep disorders were found to have the testosterone of
                        someone 15 years their senior.</li>
                    <li>People note sleep deprived people to be less attractive. How they know I am not certain, but
                        they know.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sleep Loss and the Immune System</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sleep loss reduces the immune response. People who were sleep deprived created 50% less
                        antibodies after receiving the flu vaccine then people who were getting sufficient sleep.</li>
                    <li>A single night of bad sleep can sweep away many of your killer cells essentially leaving you
                        immunodeficient ( I am not sure how this one is true, but its what the book says)</li>
                    <li>Cancer growth was much more aggressive in sleep deprived mice the tumors grew quicker and were
                        more likely to metastasize</li>
                    <li>Lack of sleep can cause the immune system to over react and have a sustained inflammatory
                        response. This can cause cancer to spread more aggressively but also means arthritic diseases
                        are negatively impacted by sleep deprivation, potentially keeping flair ups active for longer.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sleep Loss, Genes, And DNA</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The reason for probably a lot of the aforementioned negative effects is that sleep loss will
                        damage your DNA and how they are transcribed. It can cause some genes to express themselves too
                        much and others to express themselves not at all. This can cause and worsen and uncountable
                        number of problems.</li>
                    <li>Similar sleep damages the capstone telomeres (binding ends of DNA strands). Someone who is
                        chronically sleep deprived will have the damaged telomeres of someone decades their senior.
                        Medical residents were found to have very damaged telomeres as a result of program forced sleep
                        deprivation.</li>

                        experience and most usefully removes the emotional baggage attached to it.</li>
                    <li>Sleep is what heals emotional wounds.</li>
                    <li>PTSD patients are treated with drugs that help increase REM sleep this subsequently helped them

                        increased creativity. People who were woken up from REM sleep were more likely to solve a
                        creativity puzzle than their awake baseline or people who had been woken up from a different
                        stage of sleep.</li>

                        lacks the sleep cycles and rhythm of natural sleep and therefore lacks the benefits of natural
                        sleep</li>

                    <li>sleeping pills often do not help people fall asleep faster than they would without the sleeping
